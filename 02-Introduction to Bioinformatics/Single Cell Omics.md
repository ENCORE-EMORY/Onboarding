# What is Single Cell Omics?


> Recent technological advances are providing unprecedented opportunities to analyse the complexities of biological systems at the single-cell level. Various crucial biological
> phenomena are either invisible or only partially characterized when interrogated using standard analyses that average data across a bulk population of cells. However,
> high-throughput analyses of the genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes of single cells are providing novel and important insights into diverse processes such as development,
> gene-expression dynamics, tissue heterogeneity and disease pathogenesis.
